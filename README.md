# Demo AWS CloudFormation templates

I use these templates as examples in blogposts on [ig.nore.me](http://ig.nore.me). They are tested to work, and the ruby versions (which are compiled using [cfndsl](https://github.com/stevenjack/cfndsl)) contain a lot of comments about what is going on.

## The first babysteps with CloudFormation

The templates for this article can be found in cfn1-babysteps. This example demonstrates setting up two loadbalanced EC2 instances in a VPC.
